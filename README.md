Here are a list of projects that I would like to do sometime in the future, this is in no particular order nor are they anything set in stone. 

* Personal website
* Game simulation played by a nueral network 
* Website that displays a random quote/text/phrase and the user is only allowed one per day.
* Face recognistion app, that remembers faces and names.
* Robot that listens to lectures and summarises with notes. 
* Infinite board chess?
* Something with social media apis
* Program that stores all emulators in one platform, and has a marketplace for games
* IOS app that syncs notes across devices
* App that allows you to set notifications for any reason.
* Add smart contracts to pychain

These are it for now, if you would to help on any just send me a message or email!
